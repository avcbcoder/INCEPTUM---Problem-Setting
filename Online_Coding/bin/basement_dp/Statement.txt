Problem :
The beautiful city of byte-land consist of 'N' buildings. All the buildings are 
connected linearly with each other through ground floor. There are some checkpoint 
in each building at 'X'th floor. 

In one second :
1. You can go to the left building if exists.
2. You can go to the right building if exists.
3. You can go one floor above in one second.

There is only one checkpoint in each building.   

You are given 'Q' queries:
In each query you are given your current position 'P'.
You need to find the minimum time required to reach a checkpoint.

Input format :
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Description of Each test case :
First line contains one integer 'N' - the number of buildings.
Second line contains N space separated integers 'Ai' denoting checkpoints of every building. 
Third line contains Q - number of queries. 
Then, Q lines contains the position 'P'.
*Note : Indexing is 1 based
 
Output format :
For each query, print Q lines containing minimum time to reach a checkpoint for 
that query. 

Constraints :
1<=T<=50
1<=N<=100000
1<=Q<=1000
0<=A[i]<=1000000000
1<=P<=N

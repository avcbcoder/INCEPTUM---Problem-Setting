Problem :
Bert has an array 'A' which contains N elements. He creates a new array 'B' of same 
length 'N' using the elements of array A. For every index in array B, he places the 
sum of all elements of array A except at that index. 

Find the sum of all elements of array B mod (10^9 + 7).

Input :
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test cases contains two lines :
First line of the input contains 'N' - size of array.
Second line contains N space separated integers A[i] -- the elements of array A.     

Output :
For each test case, output a single number - count of the above specified subarrays.

Constraints :
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100000
1<=A[i]<=1000000000 

Sample Input : 
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
5 
8 2 6 9 3

Sample Output :
60
112

Explanation :

For Test case 1:
Array B = [14, 13, 12, 11, 10]
Sum of all elements of B = 60

For Test case 2:
Array B = [20, 26, 22, 19, 25]
Sum of all elements of B = 112

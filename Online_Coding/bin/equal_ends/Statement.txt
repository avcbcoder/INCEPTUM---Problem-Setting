Problem :
Given an array, find the number of contiguous subarrays of length>1 having same element 
at the beginning and end of subarray.
count(i,j) {1<=i<=n, i<j<=n} such that A[i]=A[j].

Input :
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test cases contains two lines :
First line of the input contains 'N' - size of array.
Second line contains N space separated integers.     

Output :
For each test case, output a single number - count of the above specified subarrays.

Constraints :
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100000
0<=A[i]<=1000000000

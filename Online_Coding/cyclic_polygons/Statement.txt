Make it a 'Cyclic Polygon'.

Problem :
You are given the skeleton of a city. It consist of N residences. Each residence can be
connected to any other residence via bi-directional road. These cities are connected 
to each other in such a way that they form a loop (cyclic polygon).But in every such 
loop there are some extra edges. You need to find the count of edges whose removal will 
make that loop 'a perfect looper'. 
 
Input format :
The first line of input contains two space separated integers 'N' (number of residences)
and 'E' (number of roads).
The following E lines contains two space separated integers 'U' and 'V' denoting a
bi-directional road between U and V.

Output format :
Print one single number -- the number

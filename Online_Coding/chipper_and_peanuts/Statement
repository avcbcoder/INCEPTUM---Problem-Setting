Chipper the Squirrel

Problem :
Chipper the squirrel is sitting on a tree. This tree is different from real world
trees. It has a set of n nodes, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, there are peanuts 
placed on m nodes.
In one step - chipper can go from one node to other whether it is above or below
in the tree hierarchy.
Note:The tree is connected i.e there exist an unique path between every two nodes.

You are given 'Q' queries :
1 X : In this case, print the nearest node containing peanut from node 'X'
2 X : In this case chipper will eat the nearest peanut from node X if any 
      peanut is left in the tree.   


Input :
The first line of the input contains two space separated integers 'N' and 'M'.
The second line contains M space separated integers denoting the nodes which
initially have the peanut.
Then the input file consist of N-1 lines containing two integers U and V denoting
an edge between node U and V.
Then input contains 'Q' -- Number of queries.
Each Query consist of one line containing two space separated integers 
'T'-Type of query, 'X'-Node X  

Output :
For each type 2 query : print the nearest node containing peanut if exists 
otherwise print -1.

Constraints :
1<=N<=100000
1<=M<=100
1<=U,V,X<=N
1<=Q<=10000
T = 1 or 2

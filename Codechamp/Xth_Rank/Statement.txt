Problem :
In every competition who comes first gets the importance. Av never liked this 
idea because coming first is not his cup of tea. Luckily in this version of 
INCEPTUM he got a chance to organize a event. So, he decided not to give the 
importance to the one who comes first and lets give it randomly.
There are N participants in his event. Participants are ranked on the basis of marks 
obtained irrespective of submission time.

He decided that he will keep track of xth rank in his event. But, he is not 
that much good in handling numbers . 
Can you help him in determining xth rank at every submission?

Input :
First line contains number N denoting number of participants and number X denoting the 
xth number to keep track of.
Second line contains N space separated numbers denoting marks obtained by participant

Output :
Print the n-x+1 lines containing only one integer - marks obtained by Xth 
ranked participant.

Constraints :
1<=N<=10^6
1<=X<=N
1<=Ni<=10^6
